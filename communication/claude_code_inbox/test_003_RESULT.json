    "message": "For consolidation output, it should be merged back into the JSONL stream and marked as 'consolidated'. This approach maintains the append-only nature of the JSONL for a complete audit trail and simplifies retrieval, as all conversational history (raw and consolidated) remains in a single logical stream. A 'consolidated' flag or a new entry type within the JSONL can indicate the summary of the merged fragments.",

    "reasoning": "Maintains append-only audit trail, simplifies data model, and aligns with intelligent consolidation patterns."
