AFTER ALL SENDS - IMPORTANT
===============================================================

1. Create a spreadsheet or document tracking:
   - Who you sent to
   - Date/time sent
   - Status (Sent/Response/Offer)

2. Check email TOMORROW MORNING for any auto-responses

3. FOLLOW-UP SCHEDULE:
   - Thursday morning (48 hours): Follow up on non-responses
   - Friday: Final outreach before semester break

4. WATCH FOR RESPONSES:
   - Positive responses = start coordinating credit allocation
   - Auto-rejection = note it and move on
   - No response after 48 hours = send follow-up

5. TRACK FUNDING TOTALS:
   - Goal: $15K-30K total
   - Expected: 3-5 companies respond positively
   - Average per company: $8K-15K

===============================================================
