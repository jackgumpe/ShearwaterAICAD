Click on "Live Log" tab → Should show "Connecting..." → Should show "Connected" → Stream of messages

### To Check Backend:
```bash
python manage.py status
```

Should show all 5 services running.

### To Check Gluade (When Ready):
```bash
cd C:\Users\user\ShearwaterAICAD
python -m gluade list
python -m gluade stats
```

## BOTTOM LINE

Everything is ready. Agents are authorized. Documentation is complete. Backend is running. Three mega-projects are launching simultaneously.

**Your next 18 days**:
1. Monitor three projects progressing in parallel
2. Test frontend visually
3. Respond to grant emails (Gluade helps)
4. By Dec 20: Fully functional, beautiful system ready

**What happens after Dec 20**:
1. Use Live Log frontend to showcase Azerate
