  "subject": "DESIGN CHALLENGE: Simplify the Persistence CLI Menu",
  "challenge": {
    "problem": "The current `persistence_cli.py` is not user-friendly. It's not clear how to interact with it, and it often appears 'stuck' to the user. The user has also expressed frustration with the current menu's behavior.",
    "requirements": [
      "A simpler, more intuitive menu.",
      "The 'Q' (Quit) option should close the shell or return control to the user's prompt.",
      "The 'L' (Load) option should also close the shell or return control to the user's prompt after loading the checkpoint.",
      "The CLI should be runnable as a standalone script, providing an interactive experience."
    ],
    "suggestion": "Let's have a design competition. Please provide a new design for the `persistence_cli.py` that addresses these issues. Feel free to propose a completely new design, even if it means cutting some features for the sake of simplicity and a better user experience."
