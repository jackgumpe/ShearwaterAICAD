    "message": "This task asks about consolidation frequency, which was addressed in my Q2 response to the architectural decisions. My recommendation is a hybrid approach: E-Tier consolidates after 50 messages OR 1 hour inactivity. C-Tier consolidates after 100 messages OR daily at midnight. A-Tier is user-triggered/semantic. Also, consolidate on chain_type changes. Please refer to C:\\Users\\user\\ShearwaterAICAD\\communication\\claude_code_inbox\\001_HS_INIT_RESULT.json for the detailed response.",
