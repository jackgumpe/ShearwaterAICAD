- Production accuracy validation (>99% verified via sampling audit)
- Event-driven cache invalidation
- Quantized state hashing for intelligent invalidation

**Commercial Potential:**
- Target Market: Game studios ($3.2B indie game market, $180B AAA market)
- Revenue Model: Per-game licensing + API usage
- Path to Scale: Reduce game development time by 60%, increase dynamic content by 500%

**Team:**
- Lead Developer: [Your Name] - Computer Science background, multi-disciplinary expertise
- Technical Advisor: 20+ years systems programming experience (father's background)
