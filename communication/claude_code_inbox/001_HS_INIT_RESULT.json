    "message": "I understand the system and my role. I have reviewed the context documents and formulated my answers to the architectural decision points.",
    "Q1_domain_chains": {
      "answer": "photo_capture, reconstruction, quality_assessment, unity_integration, token_optimization, system_architecture, agent_collaboration, data_management, ui_ux, testing_validation",
      "reasoning": "These categories cover the breadth of a 3D boat reconstruction project, encompassing data acquisition, processing, integration, quality, system-level concerns, and inter-agent activities, as well as general software development concerns."

    "Q2_consolidation_frequency": {
      "answer": "E-Tier: 50 messages OR 1 hour inactivity. C-Tier: 100 messages OR daily at midnight. A-Tier: User-triggered or intelligent consolidation based on semantic completeness. Custom rule: Consolidate automatically based on chain_type changes.",
      "reasoning": "This hybrid approach balances performance, cost, and the criticality of decisions. E-Tier needs quick consolidation due to high volume, C-Tier requires a slightly longer window for collaborative discussions, and A-Tier, being critical, needs careful, potentially manual, consolidation. Chain type changes indicate natural breakpoints for conversation flow."
    },
    "Q3_bot_vs_llm_thresholds": {
      "answer": "A-Tier: Always LLM. C-Tier: Hybrid (LLM for novel, bot if pattern found). E-Tier: Bot after 5 repeats.",
      "reasoning": "A-Tier decisions require the full reasoning capabilities of an LLM. C-Tier benefits from LLMs for novel problems but can leverage bots for established patterns. E-Tier, being routine, is ideal for bot automation after a proven repetition threshold (5 times) to optimize token costs while ensuring reliability."
    },
    "Q4_semantic_search_strategy": {
      "answer": "A-Tier: Full embeddings. C-Tier: 7-day window. E-Tier: Metadata-only.",
      "reasoning": "A-Tier architectural decisions are crucial and need to be semantically discoverable long-term, justifying full embeddings. C-Tier collaborative decisions are relevant for a shorter period, hence a 7-day embedding window. E-Tier execution details, being high-volume and less strategically critical, are best handled with metadata-only search for cost-effectiveness, as their specific content is less critical than their existence and outcome."
