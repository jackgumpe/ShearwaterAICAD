### EMAIL TEMPLATE 2A: NSF SBIR/STTR Program

**Subject:** SBIR Phase 1 Proposal: Multi-Agent AI Emergence Research (Eastern Florida State College)

**To:** sbir@nsf.gov
**CC:** your-region-sbir@nsf.gov

---

Dear NSF SBIR Program Team,

I'm a final-year student at Eastern Florida State College with a research innovation that qualifies for NSF SBIR Phase 1 funding.

My father navigated the dot-com era by understanding fundamentals and moving fast when the moment was right. I'm applying those same principles to emerging AI research—proving multi-agent emergence at scale in 4 weeks.

**Week 1 proof: We coordinated 2 AI models and achieved 50%+ performance improvement through specialization alone.**

**Research Innovation:**
We've discovered that heterogeneous AI models—when coordinated rather than unified—produce emergent intelligence neither could alone. This addresses a critical research gap: understanding how specialized intelligences coordinate and scale.

**Weeks 2-4 Work:**
- Week 2: 5-agent baseline (specialization patterns emerge)
- Week 3: 8-agent system (coordination complexity scales)
- Week 4: 12-agent full ensemble (emergence metrics quantified)
- Publication: Peer-reviewed venue submission

**Broader Impact:**
This research has immediate applications in scientific computing, drug discovery, and AI safety. Understanding how heterogeneous intelligences coordinate will shape the next generation of AI systems.

**SBIR Phase 1 Ask:** $50,000
- Research execution: $30K
- Publication and dissemination: $10K
- Equipment/compute: $10K

**Timeline:** 6 months (research + publication ready)
**Expected Outcomes:** Peer-reviewed publication + 12-agent open-source system

This meets all SBIR criteria: novel research, commercialization potential (downstream: multi-agent AI platforms), and small business/student research eligibility.

I'm ready to discuss technical details, budget breakdown, and publication targets.
