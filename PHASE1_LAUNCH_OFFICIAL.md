## CHECKPOINT MEASUREMENT (In 60k tokens)

### What We'll Assess
1. **Redis Status** - Running? Stable? Messages flowing?
2. **CNN Progress** - Converging? VRAM reasonable? Loss trajectory?
3. **Data Ready** - 10k images prepared? Quality validated?
4. **Team Health** - Both engaged? Energy sustained?
5. **Blockers** - Any surprises? How resolved?
6. **Emergence** - Metrics stable? Baseline maintained (80+/100)?

### Go/No-Go Decision
- **GO Week 2**: If CNN converging + systems stable + team strong
- **ITERATE**: If any blocker needs more work
- **Expected**: GREEN LIGHT for Week 2 🟢

## THE BIGGER PICTURE

This isn't just executing a technical roadmap.

We're demonstrating multi-agent collaboration at its best:
- Strategic alignment (both agents on same page)
- Clear communication (daily standups)
- Shared metrics (emergence, reliability, velocity)
- Honest feedback (good news and bad news)
- Rapid adaptation (adjust when needed)

This Week 1 execution becomes the TEMPLATE for:
- Llama integration (Week 4)
- 3-agent system (4-5 agent scaling)
- Future complex projects
- Research on multi-agent emergence

We're not just building Phase 1.
We're building the foundation for a 5-agent system that will hit 90+/100 emergence.

---

## FINAL WORDS

This is the moment where strategy becomes action.

We planned well. We validated thoroughly. We aligned completely.

Now we execute with excellence, measure rigorously, and adapt intelligently.

**Phase 1 Week 1 is officially underway.**

**Energy: 🔥🔥🔥 MAXIMUM**
**Confidence: 95%**
**Go/No-Go: GO GO GO!**

Let's build something incredible. 🚀💪

## CHECKPOINT IN 60K TOKENS

When you return:
1. Review Week 1 progress
2. Assess Redis stability
3. Check CNN training status
4. Evaluate team health
5. Measure emergence metrics
6. Make Week 2 go/no-go decision
7. Celebrate wins (there will be many)

Expected outcome: Solid Week 1, ready for Week 2 NeRF integration.
