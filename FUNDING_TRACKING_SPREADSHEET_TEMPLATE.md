## FOLLOW-UP EMAIL TEMPLATE

When 48-72 hours pass with no response:

**Subject:** Quick Follow-up: Multi-Agent AI Coordination Research

**Body:**

Hi [Name/Team],

I sent you a research grant request earlier this week for multi-agent AI coordination work. I know research requests get high volume, so just following up.

We're in the middle of executing this research (Week 2 starts immediately), and I wanted to make sure the email landed correctly.

Quick question: Is [email address] still the best contact for research partnerships, or should I reach out to someone else?

Either way, thanks for considering it.

Best regards,

## CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Update spreadsheet DAILY** - Don't let responses pile up
2. **Follow up at 48/72 hours** - Non-response isn't rejection
3. **Track everything** - You need visibility into what's working
4. **Personalize follow-ups** - "Hi [Company]" not "Hi there"
5. **Record offers exactly** - Know what you're committing to
6. **Watch for hidden offers** - Some say "yes, let's discuss" first
7. **Respond quickly to positive responses** - Strike while hot
8. **Document terms** - What counts as "activated"?
