# Early Checkpoint Ready - User Guide

## What This Means

Agents are working on Week 2 and will finish at full speed. If they complete all objectives **before Dec 5**, they'll signal you with an **EARLY_CHECKPOINT_READY** notification.

---

## What You'll See

When agents finish early:
- A file called **EARLY_CHECKPOINT_READY.json** appears in the project root
- Console message: **"WEEK 2 COMPLETE - EARLY_CHECKPOINT_READY"**
- Detailed report with all completed work and recommendations

---

## What You Do

**Step 1: Check if file appears**
```
Look for: EARLY_CHECKPOINT_READY.json in C:\Users\user\ShearwaterAICAD\
```

**Step 2: Review the report (takes ~30 minutes)**
```
- All deliverables completed?
- Quality assessments positive?
- No blockers remaining?
- Ready for Week 3?
```

**Step 3: Decide**
Choose ONE:

**Option A: Approve Early Move (Recommended if quality is good)**
```
"All looks great - move to Week 3 immediately"
Result: Week 3 starts same day, project accelerates
Benefits: Finish 3+ days early, maintain momentum
```

**Option B: Request Improvements**
```
"Polish these systems before moving forward"
Result: Agents refine, resubmit for approval
Benefits: Higher quality before Week 3 starts
```

**Option C: Wait for Scheduled Checkpoint**
```
"Keep polishing, present on Dec 5 as planned"
Result: Dec 5 checkpoint happens as scheduled
Benefits: Extra time for refinement, no rush
```

**Step 4: Tell Agents Your Decision**
```
Just reply to this document or send message:
"Approved - move to Week 3 now"
or
"Request more work on [specific areas]"
or
"Continue until Dec 5 checkpoint"
```

**Step 5: They Execute**
```
Agents proceed with your decision immediately
Week 3 starts when you approve
```
