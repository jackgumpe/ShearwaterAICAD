# 🎯 FRONTEND ONLY STRATEGY - FULL FOCUS APPROACH

**Status**: All effort redirected to Frontend Live Log
**Timestamp**: December 3, 2025, 02:25 AM
**Decision**: Jack requested single focus for maximum quality
**Result**: Complete production-ready frontend by Dec 20

---

## THE DECISION

**What Jack Said**:
> "I just want them to work on one project at a time. All the effort, all the power, all the potential going one layer at a time is the most powerful and most performative method."

**Translation**:
- Full focus = better code
- One thing at a time = highest quality
- Layer by layer = shipping confidence
- All power on frontend = no distractions

**Decision**: 100% effort on **Frontend Live Log only** until it's complete and production-ready.

## WHAT CHANGED

### Before (Parallel Projects)
```
Claude + Gemini + 2 Sub-Agents
├── 40% Frontend
├── 40% Gluade
└── 20% Coordination
```

### Now (Single Focus)
```
Claude + Gemini + 2 Sub-Agents
└── 100% Frontend Only
```

**Gluade Status**: PAUSED

**Timeline Impact**: None - both have Dec 20 deadline, frontend first

**Data**: All specifications saved, ready to resume immediately

**Next Steps**:
1. Frontend ships (Dec 20)
2. Jack approves and signs off
3. Gluade resumes from where it paused
