===============================================================
EMAIL STRATEGY
===============================================================

Subject Line: CRITICAL
- Make it specific, not generic
- Include institution name (shows legitimacy)
- Make them want to open it
- Example: "Novel Research: GPT-4o in Heterogeneous AI Ensembles (Eastern State Florida College)"

First Paragraph: EMOTIONAL HOOK
- Don't start with the ask
- Start with the vision
- Make them see why this matters
- Reference Week 1 proof

Call to Action: CLEAR
- Specific dollar amount ($8K-15K, not "please consider")
- Specific deliverable (they get X in return)
- Timeline (happening NOW, not "we might do this")

Attachment: PROFESSIONAL
- Use WEEK1_COMPLETION_FOR_FUNDING_PITCH.md as PDF
- Shows you're serious
- Gives them something to review

Signature: YOU
- Your name
- Your institution
- Your email
- Your phone (shows confidence and accessibility)

===============================================================
WHAT TO EXPECT
===============================================================

Best case: 3-4 companies respond within 24-48 hours
Likely case: 2-3 respond positively within 72 hours
Realistic minimum: 1-2 serious responses by Thursday

If you hit 3 positive responses:
- That's $15K-30K in credits
- Enough to scale Week 2-4 properly
- Enough to beat your own timeline

===============================================================
KEY TALKING POINTS (IF THEY CALL)
===============================================================

"We proved heterogeneous AI coordination works in Week 1. Now we're measuring emergence at scale. Your model [GPT-4o/Claude/Gemini] becomes a specialized solver in an ensemble. You want to know: does your model shine in that context?"

"This research is happening this week. Question is who funds it and whose logo goes on the paper. We want partners who believe in the mission."

"We have infrastructure, authorization, and execution framework. What we need is the fuel (API credits) to run the experiments. Investment is minimal, upside is publication and partnership."

"Worst case for your company: you don't respond and read about this research in a peer-reviewed paper funded by competitors. Best case: you're the partner known for backing the breakthrough."

===============================================================
WHAT IF YOU GET REJECTED?
===============================================================

Don't take it personally. Research funding is about timing and fit.

If someone says no:
- Ask: "Is there a better contact/program for this?"
- Follow up: "We're still interested, can we revisit in January?"
- Don't get defensive

BUT: You'll likely get at least 2-3 yeses. These companies FUND AI research. You're giving them a clear, credible ask.

===============================================================
IF YOU GET A YES
===============================================================

Reply immediately with:
1. Thank you
2. Confirm the credit amount and timeline
3. Provide technical contact (your email)
4. Ask: "How do I set up the account?"
5. Loop them into Week 2 progress updates (shows you deliver)

===============================================================
