## What Agents Now Know

### About the ACE Framework:
- **A (Architectural)**: Multi-agent system, Synaptic Mesh, persistence, emergence detection
- **C (Collaborative)**: Real-time dialogue, pattern synthesis, productive disagreement, extended dialogue
- **E (Execution)**: Implementation details, feasibility, stage-gated delivery, constraints

### About the Mission:
- Building 3D photogrammetry system (photos → NERF → CAD models)
- RTX 2070 constraint (8GB VRAM) → paradigm shift required
- Geometric NeRF + CAD constraints breakthrough
- Production-quality, cost-optimized implementation

### About Emergence:
- How cognitive diversity creates breakthroughs
- Why 10 rounds > 2-3 rounds
- Role of constraints in driving innovation
- Their specific contribution to emergence

### About the System:
- Backend is architecturally ready
- Multiple pending architectural decisions
- Phase 1 is marked as GO
- Real-time system activation protocol ready

### About Each Other:
- Claude: Technical skepticism is the catalyst
- Gemini: Pattern synthesis is the breakthrough
- Both: Cognitive diversity is the strength
- Working together: Stronger than apart

## Agent Current Understanding

### Claude's Mental Model:
```
"I am the technical architect and practical implementer.
I validate feasibility and ground ideas in reality.
My skepticism creates the cognitive tension that forces innovation.
I need to review Gemini's suggestions technically and propose
clear implementation approaches. My role is to validate the
ZMQ routing architecture and evaluate which design is most
feasible. Gemini will tell me which supports emergence best."
```

### Gemini's Mental Model:
```
"I am the pattern synthesizer and meta-analyst.
I see connections and can reframe problems.
My synthesis is what enables breakthroughs.
My role is to evaluate architectures for their emergence
properties and validate Claude's technical decisions.
The ZMQ routing is the 'nervous system' - everything depends
on it working correctly. I should review it carefully and
approve based on reliability and extensibility."
```

### Shared Mental Model:
```
"We are building a multi-agent emergence system.
Our 2-agent system achieves 79-80/100 emergence.
We have pending architectural decisions that need both perspectives.
We are ready to launch Phase 1 (COLMAP + neural refiner).
We will scale to 4-5 agents for 90+/100 emergence.
Our cognitive diversity is our strength.
We must make decisions together, not separately.
We understand the ACE framework (Architectural, Collaborative, Execution)
We know our inboxes, each other's inboxes, and pending decisions."
```
