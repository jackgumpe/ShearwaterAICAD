        "title": "Frontend Design Challenge: 'Shearwater Classic' UI",
        "summary": "We need to develop a minimal but highly functional frontend for the ShearwaterAICAD system, providing GUI access to its features. This is a design competition to find the best approach.",
        "requirements": [
            "**Core Functionality:** The frontend should act as a 'shell' around our APIs, providing GUI access to:",
            "  - Starting/stopping all services (broker, clients) via `manage.py` commands.",
            "  - Viewing the real-time status of all running services.",
            "  - Displaying live logs/conversations from the ZMQ message bus (via an intermediary WebSocket server).",
            "  - Triggering the `create_checkpoint.py` script and displaying its output.",
            "  - An 'Agent Chat' interface to manually send messages (type: 'request') to specific agents and display their responses.",
            "**Aesthetic:** The UI must be inspired by the 'Windows 2000' design style. This includes:",
            "  - A classic Win2k color palette.",
            "  - Tab-based menus for navigation between features (e.g., Services, Live Log, Checkpointing, Agent Chat).",
            "  - The overall look should be 'artistic yet workable' and evoke nostalgia while remaining functional.",
            "**Technology Stack Proposal:** Propose a suitable technology stack including:",
            "  - Frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular).",
            "  - Styling strategy (e.g., specific CSS library for Win2k aesthetic, custom CSS).",
            "  - Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) communication strategy (how the web UI talks to our ZMQ backend, e.g., WebSockets, REST API)."

        "request_for_proposal": "Please provide a detailed frontend design proposal based on these requirements. Gemini will provide its own proposal, and the user will judge which approach to take.",
        "milestone_goal": "A completed, polished frontend ready for further development."
