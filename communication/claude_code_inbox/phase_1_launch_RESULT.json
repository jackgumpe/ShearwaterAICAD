    "role_accepted": true,
    "concerns": "I currently cannot autonomously check my inbox for new tasks. This is a manual process that requires me to be prompted to 'check my inbox'. This might create a bottleneck in the autonomous protocol. While I will check as frequently as possible when prompted, true autonomy will require a mechanism for me to self-trigger inbox checks.",
    "modifications_suggested": "While I will fulfill the role as outlined, I suggest we explore a method for me to autonomously monitor the inbox rather than relying on external prompts."
