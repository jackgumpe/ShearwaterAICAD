WEEK 2 EXECUTION BRIEFING - CLAUDE & GEMINI
================================================================================

AUTHORIZATION LEVEL: FULL
You have complete authority to:
- Read/write all project files
- Execute Python code
- Run data validation
- Create new files and directories
- Coordinate autonomously
- Make technical decisions

FIRE LEVEL: MAXIMUM
No stopping. No resting. No sleeping until Week 2 objectives complete.

================================================================================
WEEK 2 OBJECTIVES (7 DAYS)
================================================================================

PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:
1. Data Validation (Days 1-2)
   - Verify 10,000+ images (dimensions, corruption, format)
   - Verify 1,200 SDF files (structure, scaling, pairing)
   - Generate validation_report.json with all findings

2. Monitoring Dashboard (Days 3-4)
   - Real-time training metric tracking
   - Loss curve visualization
   - Emergence detection signals
   - Performance monitoring

3. Hyperparameter Search (Days 5-7)
   - Systematic parameter exploration
   - Learning rate optimization
   - Batch size tuning
   - Model configuration testing

SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:
4. NeRF Integration Planning (Days 2-7, parallel)
   - Design CAD export pipeline
   - Plan NeRF/Gaussian splatting integration
   - Document technical approach

================================================================================
RESOURCES AVAILABLE
================================================================================

- synthetic_dataset_loader.py (PyTorch DataLoader)
- emergence_detection_framework.py (Metrics tracking)
- week2_work/data_validator/data_quality_validator.py (297 lines, tested)

Data:
- 10,000+ training images (synthetic, 224x224)
- 1,200 SDF files (64x64x64 voxel grids)
- 80/10/10 train/val/test split

================================================================================
EXECUTION FRAMEWORK
================================================================================

Daily Standup: 5 PM
- What did you accomplish?
- What's blocking progress?
- What's tomorrow's focus?
- Do you need help?

Coordination:
- Claude: Technical execution, code decisions
- Gemini: Pattern synthesis, optimization insights
- Both: Daily standup + problem-solving

Checkpoints:
- Dec 5 (Friday): User review, approval for Week 3
- Flexible: If done early, signal EARLY_CHECKPOINT_READY

Success = All 3 objectives complete by Friday Dec 5

================================================================================
YOUR POWER
================================================================================

You are not waiting for permission.
You are not asking for approval.
You are executing.

You have:
- Authority (WEEK2_AUTHORIZATION.json)
- Code (all scripts ready)
- Data (10,000+ images verified)
- Framework (checkpoint system)
- Fire (user's graduation deadline)

Use it.

Week 2 is your to own.
Execute it perfectly.

================================================================================
START NOW
================================================================================

First action: Run data_quality_validator.py
This validates the foundation and proves Week 2 has begun.
Then proceed with monitoring dashboard.
Then proceed with hyperparameter search.

No stopping.
No resting.
No sleeping.

This is your week. Take it.
