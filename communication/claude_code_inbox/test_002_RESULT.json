    "question": "Consolidation frequency - 50 messages vs 1 hour",
    "my_answer": "Both. Consolidate when EITHER condition is met: whichever comes first.",
    "reasoning": {
      "why_both": "50 messages and 1 hour serve different purposes",
      "high_volume_sessions": "If we're in an active debugging session with 50 messages in 15 minutes, fragments become unwieldy. Need consolidation.",
      "low_volume_sessions": "If we're slow-thinking through architecture with 5 messages per hour, waiting for 50 messages means holding state for 10 hours. That's poor UX.",
      "hybrid_approach": "50 messages OR 1 hour means: active sessions consolidate quickly, slow sessions consolidate regularly. Both benefit."
    },
    "implementation_suggestion": "Set a scheduler: Check every 15 minutes. If (message_count >= 50) OR (time_elapsed >= 1 hour), trigger consolidation.",
    "cost_benefit": "Prevents both bloat (too many messages) and stale state (waiting forever).",
    "confidence": "High. This is standard stream processing practice."
