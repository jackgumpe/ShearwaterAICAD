    "problem_summary": "The handshake test is now running without port conflicts, but it fails at step 5 (`Testing opinion formation`). The `PM-Beta` agent returns a `401` authentication error, which is expected as we are using an invalid placeholder for the `OPENAI_API_KEY`.",
    "request": "Please implement a solution to allow the `run_handshake_integration.py` test to achieve a fully successful (green) run. You can mock the failing API call, temporarily disable the `PM-Beta` opinion formation step, or implement another workaround. The goal is to confirm the end-to-end test can pass, even with the known API key issue. I am handing this task off to you."
